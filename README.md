# SketchSense - A Drawing Classifier üñç

Welcome to the Drawing Classifier ML project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify sketches into predefined categories. It's a perfect tool for educational purposes, learning how different clasification algorithms work.

## Classification Algos used üóÑ

- Linear SVC (Support Vector Machine)
- K Neighbours Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

## Features ‚ú®

- **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy. It can be used to add more ML algorithms like regression, tensor etc. as per required by user.

- **Tk-inter UI**: Includes models that have been trained on a variety of sketch datasets, offering robust classification

- For other python libraries used check requirements.txt file

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Drawing Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aapoorvv/SketchSense
   cd SketchSense

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage üîé
1. Run the classifier GUI:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Use the GUI to upload a drawing and the model will classify it.
